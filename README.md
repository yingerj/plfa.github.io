# My PLFA "Homework"

I (Jack Yinger) am working through PLFA for fun. This is a fork of [PLFA](https://github.com/plfa/plfa.github.io) that I'm using to track my progress.

[Here's a diff showing all my changes since I forked.](https://github.com/yingerj/plfa.github.io/compare/dev...my_progress)

My textual additions are "notes to self" to aid me in thinking things throug, and as a result haven't been edited.
